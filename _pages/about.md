I am deeply passionate about AI theory and applications. 
I am a PhD Candidate of Neuroscience and Neurotechnology at Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey. 
My thesis supervisors are [Uğur Halıcı](http://users.metu.edu.tr/halici/) and [Bülent Elibol](http://www.hastane.hacettepe.edu.tr/115.html?drid=146).

Research
======
The aim of my thesis research is to develop explainable AI solutions for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. 
To acquire general solution for the hard problem of diagnostics, I use open data-sets of neuroimages based on wide range of neuroimaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) , functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomograpy (PET) . 
In addition to supervised methodologies I am interested in developing semi-supervised and unsupervised techniques and exploring their generalization abilities beyond limited data-sets as well.
