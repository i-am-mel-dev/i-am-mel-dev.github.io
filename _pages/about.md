Research
======
The aim of my thesis research is to develop explainable AI solutions for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. 
To acquire general solution for the hard problem of diagnostics, I use open data-sets of neuroimages based on wide range of neuroimaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) , functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomograpy (PET) . 
In addition to supervised methodologies I am interested in developing explainable methodologies for deep learning models and exploring their generalization abilities beyond limited data-sets as well.
